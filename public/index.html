            <h2>Embarking on a New Adventure</h2>
            <p>Welcome, fellow travelers and friends! I'm thrilled to share the details of my upcoming solo van journey from Fort Worth, Texas, to the beautiful landscapes of Montana, with a special stop in the Ozarks. This trip is more than just travel; it's a journey of recovery, discovery, and shared moments with my two wonderful small dogs.</p>
            <p>This website is designed to keep my loved ones updated, provide helpful information about the trip, and offer a space for connection. Safety, comfort, and the well-being of my canine companions are my top priorities, especially as I continue my recovery from cancer. </p>
            <p>Feel free to explore the detailed itinerary, find essential emergency information, sign my guest book, or learn more about me and how you can support my adventure. You can even see my journey unfolding on the live map!</p>
